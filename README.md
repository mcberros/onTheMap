# onTheMap

Application for [Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003)

After log in in the application, it shows a map or a table with information posted by other students. The map will contain pins that shows the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.

The concepts learnt in the course [iOS Networking with Swift](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-networking-with-swift--ud421), will be used here.
